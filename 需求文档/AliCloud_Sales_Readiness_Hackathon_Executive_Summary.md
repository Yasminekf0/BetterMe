AliCloud Sales Readiness Lab
Executive Summary & Hackathon Alignment
Executive Summary
AliCloud Sales Readiness Lab is an AI-powered training and coaching system designed to help
enterprise sales teams move from product knowledge to real-world execution readiness.
Alibaba Cloud operates in a fast-moving environment with frequent product launches, pricing
changes, and regulatory requirements. While certifications test knowledge, they do not adequately
prepare sales teams for live conversations involving objections, competitive positioning, and technical
clarity.
This project introduces a 'Master Trainer' AI that simulates realistic enterprise buyer conversations,
evaluates responses, and delivers explainable, evidence-based feedback. The system is designed to
coach like a human mentor, not function as a generic chatbot.
The hackathon MVP demonstrates an end-to-end loop: practice through AI roleplay, structured
evaluation, and execution reinforcement through automatically generated follow-up emails grounded
in the actual conversation.
Built entirely using Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and open-source technologies, this solution is
designed to scale across internal sales teams, solution architects, and partner ecosystems.

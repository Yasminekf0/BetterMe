 AI Hackathon Teaser & Topic Overview
 Welcome to the AI Hackathon!
January 16–17 — 24 hours of innovation
Organized by La FrenchTech Shanghai, this immersive 24‑hour sprint brings together creators,
engineers, designers, entrepreneurs and AI enthusiasts to build impactful solutions in a single intense
burst of collaboration.
Prepare for 48 hours of creativity, cafeine, collaboration, and bold innovation! This hackathon brings
together developers, analysts, designers, product thinkers, and dreamers from every background.
Whether you're here to test your technical limits, explore AI for the very frst time, or help build a
product that could genuinely change the world — you're in the right place.
Our mission? Turn diverse talent into powerful solutions. You'll not only build AI systems — you'll shape
full products: from concept and branding, to UX fows, to functional prototypes ready to pitch. 
This competition is designed to: - Inspire real-world problem solving - Empower beginner and
advanced participants - Encourage bold, creative experimentation - Produce tangible, demo￾ready AI products 
You choose your challenge. You choose your tools. You choose how far to push the limits.
And yes… there are prizes. For each topic. And one grand winner.
 What’s Expected — Product, Not Just Prototype
Each team is encouraged to deliver a complete product vision, including:
 Functional prototype or working demo
 UI/UX mockups or interface
 Clear product message & branding
 Value proposition & user scenarios
 Final pitch presentation
We’ll provide trainings, tools, and datasets. Thanks to our technical sponsors STMicroelectronics and
Alibaba Cloud, participants can leverage:
 STM32N6 Edge AI development boards (embedded & CV)
 Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (LLMs, CV models, analytics)
 DashVector, OSS, PAI‑DSW, PAI‑Designer, etc.
These tools are optional — you’re also free to use any open‑source or approved tech stack. But taking
advantage of these pre‑integrated ecosystems can boost your development speed — especially for
Edge AI, LLMs, forecasting, and CV challenges. You bring ambition. And curiosity. And memes.
(Optional, but highly recommended.)

This is a competition — but creativity wins. The rules? Flexible. The expectations? High. The potential?
Huge.
Evaluation criteria exist — but won’t be fully revealed until the event. 
 Topic One-Pagers
 Guardian Co‑Pilot — Edge AI That Protects & Assists
 Teaser
Imagine an AI that watches over drivers and passengers like a guardian angel — detecting risky
situations, fatigue, and unsafe posture, all on‑device. No cloud. No delay. No privacy compromises.
From long‑haul trucks to shared mobility, millions of lives depend on safer cabins. You could build tech
that prevents accidents, saves lives, and becomes a global standard.
 Suggested Tools & Datasets
• Edge AI SDKs
• Pose estimation datasets
• Embedded development boards
• On‑device inference frameworks
 Deliverable Expectations
• Real‑time detection/monitoring MVP
• Companion UI for feedback or alerts
• Messaging/branding around safety & ethics
• Demo showcasing real-world scenarios
Impact potential? Transform transportation safety. Personal gains? Master Edge AI + CV.
 Health Decoder — Wellness From a Single Snapshot
 Teaser
Wellness shouldn’t require labs. What if a simple captured image could reveal hydration levels and
guide healthier habits? Imagine empowering athletes, parents, travelers, and doctors with instant
insights.
You will explore the frontier where visual biomarkers meet consumer tech — democratizing personal
health.
 Suggested Tools & Datasets
• Sample image datasets
2
• Computer vision models
• Predictive analytics frameworks
• Cloud‑based inference tools
 Deliverable Expectations
• Visual analysis + hydration scoring

• User education & health campaign branding
• Product demo for real‑world use cases
Impact potential? Accessible health. Personal gains? CV + DS for diagnostics.
 Master Trainer — AI That Coaches Like a Human
 Teaser
Imagine an AI coach that trains people through natural conversation — teaching, evaluating,
encouraging, and simulating real interactions. From sales to education, training becomes scalable and
personalized.
This is your chance to build a mentor — not just a bot — one that understands nuance, evaluates
responses, and tailors feedback.
 Suggested Tools & Datasets
• Conversational LLMs
• Knowledge bases / documents
• Agent frameworks
• Feedback & scoring logic
 Deliverable Expectations
• Interactive dialogue experience
• Assessment and feedback loops

# Topic C: BA AI Coach
## Empowering Beauty Advisors from "Learning" to "Mastery"

**Sponsor:** L'Oreal China

---

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

**The Problem:** In the fast-evolving beauty retail industry, a key challenge is how to efficiently and accurately deliver critical information—such as new product launches, major campaigns, and trending social topics—to consumers through Beauty Advisors (BAs) in store for better consumer experience.

**Current Issue:** Traditional classroom training offers limited time for practice, resulting in BAs who may have "learned" but not truly "mastered" the skills.

**Your Mission:** Leverage an AI-powered coaching tool that enables BAs to independently practice consumer conversations in natural language, bridging the gap between knowledge acquisition and real-world application.

**The Solution Should:**
- Help BAs simulate dialogues with various consumer types
- Adapt to different scenarios
- Receive targeted feedback based on specific evaluation criteria
- Ultimately accelerate BA upskilling
